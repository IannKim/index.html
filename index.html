      <p><strong>The World Wide Web Consortium <i>(W3C)</i></strong> is an
        international community where
      Member organizations, a full-time staff, and the public work together to
      develop Web standards. Led by Web inventor and Director Tim Berners-Lee
      and CEO Jeffrey Jaffe, W3C's mission is to lead the Web to its full potential.

      <p><strong>HTML</strong> is <u>the language for describing the structure
        of Web pages</u>. HTML gives authors the <strong>means</strong> to:
Publish online documents with <strong><i>headings, text, tables, lists, photos, etc</i></strong>.
Retrieve online information via hypertext links, at the click of a button.
Design forms for conducting transactions with remote services, for use in searching
for information, making reservations, ordering products, etc.
Include spread-sheets, video clips, sound clips, and other applications directly
in their documents.
With HTML, authors describe the structure of pages using markup. The elements
 of the language label pieces of content such as “paragraph,” “list,” “table,”
 and so on.</p>

  <h1>What is XHTML?</h1>
      <p><strong>XHTML</strong> is a <u>variant</u> of HTML that uses the <u>syntax</u> of XML,
        <strong>the Extensible Markup Language</strong>. XHTML has all the same elements (for paragraphs, etc.) as the HTML
   variant, but the syntax is slightly different. Because XHTML is an XML application,
   you can use other XML tools with it (such as XSLT, a language for transforming
    XML content).</p>

    <h1>What is CSS?</h1>
        <p><strong>CSS</strong> is the language for <u>describing the presentation
           of Web pages</u>, including <strong><i>colors,layout, and fonts</i></strong>. It allows one
           to adapt the presentation to different types of
      devices, such as largSe screens, small screens, or printers. CSS is independent of
      HTML and can be used with any XML-based markup language. The separation of HTML
      from CSS makes it easier to maintain sites,S share style sheets across pages, and
      tailor pages to different environments. This is referred to as the separation of
      structure (or: content) from presentation.</p>
